# 📚 Enter The Library

> *“Loosely Matrix-themed, fully book-obsessed.”*

**Enter The Library** is a simple yet powerful book logging system built as part of [The Odin Project’s](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library) curriculum — specifically the **Library Project**. The goal was to apply DOM manipulation, object management, and form handling in a functional, browser-based app.

This app lets you:

* ✅ Add new books via a dynamic form
* 📖 Mark books as read
* ❌ Delete books from your collection
* 🌐 View your book list rendered directly in the browser

## 🚀 What I Learned

This project challenged me in a few awesome ways:

* Creating and handling forms using the `<dialog>` and modal
* Managing dynamic content in the DOM
* Storing and manipulating book objects in arrays
* Connecting user interaction to data flow

It helped me level up my vanilla JavaScript skills in a hands-on, creative way.

## 🔍 Reflections

One thing I definitely want to improve on is leaving comments in my code.
This project has **zero comments**, and while it works great, future me might not be too happy about that.

Moving forward, I aim to:

* Add inline comments, especially in complex logic
* Leave notes in my CSS to explain layout choices and overrides

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This was a genuinely fun and rewarding project. I enjoyed building it from the ground up and solving each challenge one step at a time. The Odin Project continues to push me in the best way — and I’m looking forward to what’s next!
