# Introduction

In this project we will be building a simple library that collects basic information about books and displays it in the web browser. It will gather information based on a form that is accessed via a clickable button 

Okay so this project didn't start with a plan as the first steps of the project brief were pretty self explanatory.

# Planning

## Step 1

Step 1 is actually more like step 3, but we are going to be planning a little bit differently this time. Instead of creating a whole plan we are going to be tackling each section piece by piece. The reason for this is because every step iks going to feel like a mountain and planning the whole trek is going to be a daunting task, its best to focus on scaling each mountain individually.

Okay with the hiking metaphors out of the way lets focus on the current task.

### The Form

At this point we have built the mechanism which displays our books how we want in the web browser now its time to create the form that will add the books.

for this we will use something called a <dialog> this will contain a form that will be triggered when the button is pressed.

I have never made one of these personally so it will be best just to dive in a get moving.

Although I haven't use <dialog> I have made forms so my first job will be to create the form and get that working smoothly before making it a pop up feature.

The form needs the following inputs

- Title (textbox)
- Author (textbox)
- page count (numbers)
- description (textarea)
- read (checkbox)
- image (file upload)

For now i will get to work on this and when I reach a hurdle I will be back to plan some more.
